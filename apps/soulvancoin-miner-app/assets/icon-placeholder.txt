This directory should contain application icons:

- icon.png (512x512) - For Linux AppImage
- icon.ico - For Windows installer
- icon.icns - For macOS DMG

These files are not included in the repository.
You can generate them from a PNG source using tools like:
- electron-icon-builder
- png2icons
- Online icon converters

The app will still work without these files, but the installers will use default icons.
