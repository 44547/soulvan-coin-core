# Upgrade guide to 2.0.0

This guide describes breaking changes and recommended migration steps for `soulvan-coin-core` moving to v2.0.0.

## Summary
- 2.0.0 is primarily a metadata, documentation, and release infrastructure update.
- No breaking API changes yet, as the project is in early development.

## Migration Steps
- If you depend on internal packages, switch to the new public APIs (TBD).
- Update your build scripts to read version from the `VERSION` file or repository metadata.

More details will be added as features stabilize.
